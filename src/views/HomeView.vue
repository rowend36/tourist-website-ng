      <h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
      <img class="body-image float-left" src="../assets/houses_dusk_namnso-ukpanah-6UqJTfoXIq8-unsplash.jpg" />

      <p>Despite its many strengths, Nigeria faces several challenges, including poverty, corruption, and security
        concerns. The country is one of the poorest in the world, with high levels of income inequality and unemployment.
        Corruption is also a significant problem, with Nigeria ranking poorly on global indices of corruption and
        transparency.</p>

      <p>Security concerns are also a significant challenge in Nigeria, particularly in the northern and central parts of
        the country. The rise of Boko Haram, a jihadist group, has led to widespread violence and displacement, with many
        Nigerians forced to flee their homes. The country has also experienced conflict between herders and farmers,
        leading to further violence and displacement.
      </p>

      <p>Despite these challenges, Nigeria is a country with enormous potential and many opportunities. The country has a
        large and growing population, with a significant youth demographic that is increasingly connected to the digital
        world. This presents opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the tech sector.</p>
      <p>

        Nigeria is also rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, providing opportunities for economic
        growth and development. The country has made significant strides in recent years, with the government implementing
        economic reforms and attracting foreign investment.
      </p>

      <img class="body-image" src="../assets/house_sprawl_AdobeStock_359317143_Preview.jpeg" />
      <p>In addition, Nigeria's strategic location and membership in regional organizations such as the Economic Community
        of West African States (ECOWAS) make it an important player in regional and continental affairs. The country has
        played a key role in promoting peace and security in West Africa and has been involved in mediation efforts in
        regional conflicts.</p>

      <p>

        In conclusion, Nigeria is a country with a rich and diverse cultural heritage, enormous potential, and many
        opportunities. While it faces significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and security concerns,
        Nigeria has made significant progress in recent years and has the potential to become a regional and global leader
        in various fields.
